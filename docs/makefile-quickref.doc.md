make logs-postgres # PostgreSQL only
```

### Development Services

```bash
make dev-api       # API agent locally
make dev-registry  # Plugin registry locally
make dev-worker    # Ray worker locally
```

### Test Variations

```bash
make test-unit     # Unit tests only
make test-api      # API tests only
make test-verbose  # Verbose output
make test-file file=test_api_jobs.py  # Specific file

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Scenarios

### "I want to start working"

```bash
make dev
make dev-api       # In new terminal
```

### "I made changes, test them"
